# DiversityIndex
1. Calculates the Gini-Simpson Diversity Index for a weighted random generated sample
2. Computes the average and spread for a specified number of iterations
3. Plots the average and spread as a function of simulated population size
4. Demonstrates increase in uncertainty in diversity index in smaller populations
